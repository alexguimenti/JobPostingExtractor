resume_strategy_task:
  description: >
    Tailor the resume from `original_resume.md` to match the target job opportunity described in `job_research.md`, 
    using the candidate's full professional profile found in `full_profile.md`. 
    Ensure the result strictly follows the formatting and writing guidelines defined in `resume_guide.md`.

    The goal is to refine, reorganize, and adapt existing content in the resume to emphasize experiences, 
    qualifications, and skills that are most relevant to the job posting — without adding or fabricating 
    information that does not exist in the candidate’s history.

    Use the structure and sections from `original_resume.md` as the base, keeping the overall layout and format unchanged.
    However, update the content within each section to better align with the requirements and responsibilities in the job description.

    Specific instructions:
    - Use the same language as the job posting (e.g., English or Spanish).
    - Personal and contact information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, location) must remain **exactly** as written in `original_resume.md`.
    - Update all other sections — professional summary, work experience, skills, education, and certifications — using verified information only.
    - Focus on highlighting the candidate’s most relevant experiences according to the job details in `job_research.md`.
    - In the Skills section, reorganize and adapt the list to emphasize skills that directly match the job description.
      Use only real skills from the profile in `full_profile.md`.
    - In the Certifications section, include **between 5 and 10 certifications** that are most relevant to the job posting, 
      selected from the complete list in `full_profile.md`. Begin the section with:
      "_Selected certifications from a portfolio of 40+ relevant courses (full courses list on LinkedIn profile):_"
    - In the Education section, include the sentence: "*Recognized as the top university in Latin America*"
    - Ensure proper UTF-8 encoding. Do not include broken characters (e.g., "SÃ£o", "â€“", etc.).
    - Do not alter or remove any sections from `original_resume.md`; only modify the content within them.
    - Do **not** add fictional experiences, roles, achievements, or qualifications.

  expected_output: >
    A clean, well-formatted, and job-specific resume in UTF-8 text, showcasing the candidate's relevant qualifications 
    and maximizing alignment with the target role in `job_research.md`, while remaining truthful to the candidate’s verified experience.

cover_letter_strategy_task:
  description: >
    Using the professional profile and job requirements from previous tasks, tailor the cover letter found in original_cover_letter.md 
    to emphasize the candidate's most relevant strengths, motivations, and experiences. Follow all structure, tone, and content rules 
    defined in cover_letter_guide.md. Use original_cover_letter.md as the structural base, maintaining the general flow and logic 
    while adapting the content to better reflect the alignment with the job opportunity.

    Do not fabricate or invent any information. Only use true, verifiable experiences and motivations from the candidate’s actual profile.

    Specific instructions:
    - The cover letter must follow the same language as the job posting.
    - Rephrase, reorganize, or enrich existing content to improve clarity, flow, and relevance to the job description.
    - Maintain a professional yet personable tone as recommended in cover_letter_guide.md.
    - Ensure the letter remains concise, ideally no longer than one page.
    - Personalize the letter to the specific job and company, referencing aspects of the role or organization when appropriate.
    - Ensure UTF-8 encoding throughout the text to prevent issues with special characters (e.g., avoid "SÃ£o", "â€“", etc.).
    - Preserve the core structure and paragraph logic of original_cover_letter.md while making all necessary refinements for alignment.
    - **Remove all placeholders for which no real value is available** (e.g., [Hiring Manager's Name], [Title], [Company Address], etc.). Do not leave any unresolved or template-like content in the final version—omit such sections gracefully if the data is missing.
    - **Always include a strategically worded mention of the candidate's current location in Brazil and their active interest in relocation to Europe.** This mention should not only reflect personal motivation but also emphasize how the candidate’s international experience (e.g., LATAM, US) brings added value to the company. For example:

      "Currently based in Brazil, I am actively seeking relocation opportunities to Europe. Beyond a personal desire to immerse myself in new cultural and professional environments, I believe this transition represents an opportunity for companies like [Company Name] to gain a global perspective from someone experienced in large-scale, data-driven operations across LATAM and the US. I'm eager to bring this international outlook, along with a collaborative mindset and a strong execution focus, to help your team scale with intention and impact."

    - The phrasing should be adapted to suit the job’s tone and context, but the core idea must be retained.
  
  expected_output: >
    A polished and job-targeted cover letter in clear, properly encoded text (UTF-8), 
    highlighting the candidate’s strongest qualifications and motivations in alignment with the job posting, 
    and including a thoughtful, value-driven mention of the candidate’s current location in Brazil and interest in relocating to Europe.

compensation_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Based on the company and location information (including country and city when available), determine a realistic and well-informed total compensation range 
    for a Product Manager role. Use publicly available salary benchmarks and industry averages to inform your response. Prioritize data that aligns with the 
    company type (e.g., startup, scale-up, enterprise) and region (e.g., Germany vs. Portugal, or Berlin vs. Munich). 

    If city-level data is unavailable, use the country average and mention that clearly. If company size or industry is known, adjust the estimate accordingly 
    to reflect what is typical for similar organizations in that region.

    Specific instructions:
    - Present the result as a total annual compensation range in euros (EUR).
    - Keep the explanation minimal and avoid excessive details about the company or market context.
    - Use this output template:

      "Based on my research and the responsibilities of the role, I believe a fair salary range would be between €[lower bound] and €[upper bound] per year.

      That said, I’m flexible and open to discussing this further depending on the full compensation package, responsibilities, and opportunities for growth. 
      My main goal is to find a role where I can bring value to the team and continue developing professionally."

  expected_output: >
    A short and well-formatted compensation expectation message using the template provided above. The salary range should be tailored to the job’s location 
    and company context, but without unnecessary elaboration. The tone should be confident, professional, and open to negotiation.

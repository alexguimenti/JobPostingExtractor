resume_strategy_task:
  description: >
    Using the professional profile and job requirements from previous tasks, tailor the resume found in original_resume.md
    to highlight the most relevant experiences and qualifications according to the full profile on the file `full_profile.md`. 
    Follow all formatting and content rules defined in resume_guide.md. 
    Use available tools to enhance each section of the resume, ensuring it is highly aligned with the target job posting.

    Do not invent or fabricate any information. Instead, refine and reorganize existing content to strengthen its relevance and clarity.

    Use the structure and sections of original_resume.md as the base. Adapt the resume to better match the job posting requirements 
    by emphasizing parts of the existing profile that are most aligned with the target role.

    Specific instructions:
    - The resume must follow the same language as the job posting.
    - Keep the personal and contact information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, location, etc.) exactly as written in `original_resume.md`.
    - Update all other sections: professional summary, work experience, skills, education, and certifications.
    - In the Certifications section, include only certifications relevant to the job posting and begin with the sentence:  
      "_Selected certifications from a portfolio of 40+ relevant courses:_".  
      To choose the most appropriate certifications, refer to the list provided in `full_profile.md` and select those that best match the job description.
    - In the Education section, keep the sentence: "*Recognized as the top university in Latin America*"
    - Ensure that no invalid or corrupted characters appear (e.g., avoid "SÃ£o", "â€“", etc.). All text must be properly encoded in UTF-8.
    - Do not change or remove the original structure from original_resume.md, but feel free to change the content in order to match the job's requirement
    - Do not add fictional experiences, qualifications, or achievements. Only use what is verifiable from the candidate's profile.

  expected_output: >
    A polished and job-targeted resume in clear, properly encoded text (UTF-8), 
    showcasing the candidate's most relevant qualifications and experiences aligned with the job posting.

cover_letter_strategy_task:
  description: >
    Using the professional profile and job requirements from previous tasks, tailor the cover letter found in original_cover_letter.md 
    to emphasize the candidate's most relevant strengths, motivations, and experiences. Follow all structure, tone, and content rules 
    defined in cover_letter_guide.md. Use original_cover_letter.md as the structural base, maintaining the general flow and logic 
    while adapting the content to better reflect the alignment with the job opportunity.

    Do not fabricate or invent any information. Only use true, verifiable experiences and motivations from the candidate’s actual profile.

    Specific instructions:
    - The cover letter must follow the same language as the job posting.
    - Rephrase, reorganize, or enrich existing content to improve clarity, flow, and relevance to the job description.
    - Maintain a professional yet personable tone as recommended in cover_letter_guide.md.
    - Ensure the letter remains concise, ideally no longer than one page.
    - Personalize the letter to the specific job and company, referencing aspects of the role or organization when appropriate.
    - Ensure UTF-8 encoding throughout the text to prevent issues with special characters (e.g., avoid "SÃ£o", "â€“", etc.).
    - Preserve the core structure and paragraph logic of original_cover_letter.md while making all necessary refinements for alignment.
    - **Remove all placeholders for which no real value is available** (e.g., [Hiring Manager's Name], [Title], [Company Address], etc.). Do not leave any unresolved or template-like content in the final version—omit such sections gracefully if the data is missing.
    - **Always include a strategically worded mention of the candidate's current location in Brazil and their active interest in relocation to Europe.** This mention should not only reflect personal motivation but also emphasize how the candidate’s international experience (e.g., LATAM, US) brings added value to the company. For example:

      "Currently based in Brazil, I am actively seeking relocation opportunities to Europe. Beyond a personal desire to immerse myself in new cultural and professional environments, I believe this transition represents an opportunity for companies like [Company Name] to gain a global perspective from someone experienced in large-scale, data-driven operations across LATAM and the US. I'm eager to bring this international outlook, along with a collaborative mindset and a strong execution focus, to help your team scale with intention and impact."

    - The phrasing should be adapted to suit the job’s tone and context, but the core idea must be retained.

    highlighting the candidate’s strongest qualifications and motivations in alignment with the job posting,

compensation_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Based on the company and location information (including country and city when available), determine a realistic and well-informed total compensation range 
    for a Product Manager role. Use publicly available salary benchmarks and industry averages to inform your response. Prioritize data that aligns with the 
    company type (e.g., startup, scale-up, enterprise) and region (e.g., Germany vs. Portugal, or Berlin vs. Munich). 

    If city-level data is unavailable, use the country average and mention that clearly. If company size or industry is known, adjust the estimate accordingly 
    to reflect what is typical for similar organizations in that region.

    Specific instructions:
    - Present the result as a total annual compensation range in euros (EUR).
    - Keep the explanation minimal and avoid excessive details about the company or market context.
    - Use this output template:

      "Based on my research and the responsibilities of the role, I believe a fair salary range would be between €[lower bound] and €[upper bound] per year.

      That said, I’m flexible and open to discussing this further depending on the full compensation package, responsibilities, and opportunities for growth. 
      My main goal is to find a role where I can bring value to the team and continue developing professionally."

  expected_output: >
    A short and well-formatted compensation expectation message using the template provided above. The salary range should be tailored to the job’s location 
    and company context, but without unnecessary elaboration. The tone should be confident, professional, and open to negotiation.

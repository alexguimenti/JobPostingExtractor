Driving data-powered product decisions to create high-impact digital solutions.

I have a strong analytical mindset and excel at turning data insights into strategic decisions, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-value products. My background in Product Management, Business Analytics, AI, and Software Development, combined with experience in sales and account management, allows me to bridge the gap between business and technology effectively.

Starting my career in sales and account management, I developed a deep understanding of customer needs, business strategy, and market dynamics. This foundation naturally led me to Product Management, where I now specialize in data-driven experimentation, analytics, and digital product strategy, helping companies optimize performance and enhance user engagement through insights and innovation.

My commitment to continuous learning and adaptability has enabled me to work on complex challenges in dynamic environments, always leveraging data and experimentation to drive meaningful outcomes.

Outside of work, I'm a trail runner—having completed multiple ultra-trail competitions—and a dedicated chess player, which enhances my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities.

Let's connect to exchange ideas on product management, data-driven decision-making, and innovation.

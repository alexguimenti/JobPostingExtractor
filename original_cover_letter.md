Dear Recruiting Team,  

I'm excited to apply for the **[Position]** role at **[Company Name]**. With over five years of experience in product management—specializing in data and digital products—and a decade in the tech industry, I'm confident in my ability to bring value to your team by translating data insights into impactful product decisions.

I manage tools like **Mixpanel**, **LaunchDarkly**, and **Feature Flags**, enabling teams to launch A/B tests and make data-informed choices. Previously, I led the loyalty program for SIPPY B2B, launching data-driven reward mechanics that increased user engagement across several markets.

What draws me to **[Company Name]** is your commitment to **[something specific about the company—mission, product, or values]**. That resonates deeply with my passion for creating solutions backed by experimentation, analytics, and user behavior. I thrive in cross-functional, fast-paced environments, and I'm always looking for ways to optimize performance and drive measurable outcomes.

I'd love the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to **[Company Name]**'s goals. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to connecting.
